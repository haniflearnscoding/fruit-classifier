<h1>Fruit Classifier</h1>

The model is classifying the following fruits:

* Strawberry
* Orange
* Mango
* Kiwi
* Grapes
* Cherry
* Banana
* Apple

The model was trained on 40 images of each of the different classifiers. 

The number of epoch was set to 50, with a learning rate of 0.001. 

When looking for the datasets, it was important for each of the classifiers to have a diverse set of images. 

Fruits such as Banana, Mango and Kiwi that have a similar shade of green depending on the ripeness of the fruit makes it tricky for the machine at time, 

Therefore having different shades of color within the same classifier was critical for accuracy.
